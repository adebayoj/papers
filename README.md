List of Papers to Read
=====================
This repository will keep track of interesting papers that I have
recently read or adding to a list to read. If a paper has a link
then the link we lead directly to the paper summary. 


I am generally interested in security, fairness, interpretability,
robustness, and privacy for ML based systems. Most of the
papers I read will skew that way. I will not be restricting
myself to just these topics though. 

If you find an interesting paper that you'd like to suggest, feel
free to put it in the queue.

### Robustness and Verification for ML

* Verifiable Reinforcement Learning via Policy Extraction, Bastani et. al. 2018.

* Training verified learners with learned verifiers, Dvijotham et. al. 2018

* A dual approach to scalable verification of deep networks,  Dvijotham et. al. 2018

* Measuring Neural Net Robustness with Constraints, Bastani et. al.

### Intepretability
