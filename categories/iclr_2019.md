ICLR 2019 Submissions
=====================
I did an initial pass of open review and some of the ICLR submissions that we
posted. Here are the ones that caught my eye. I am mostly thinking about
interpretability, robustness, privacy etc these days so I lean heavily towards these areas. 


### Theory/Stability 
[Stable Recurrent Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hygxb2CqKm)

[The Singular Values of Convolutional Layers](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJevYoA9Fm)

### Miscellaneous Interesting Looking ones
[Learning a SAT Solver from Single-Bit Supervision](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJMC_iA5tm)

### Why does a phenomenon work type papers (empirical and theory)
[Pooling Is Neither Necessary nor Sufficient for Appropriate Deformation Stability in CNNs](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJeuOiRqKQ)

[Why do deep convolutional networks generalize so poorly to small image transformations?](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJxYwiC5tm)


### Interpretability

[Exploring the interpretability of LSTM neural networks over multi-variable data](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HklVMnR5tQ)

[Feature Attribution As Feature Selection](https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1lS8oA5YQ)

[Interpreting Layered Neural Networks via Hierarchical Modular Representation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyed4i05KX)
